# 🫁 Lung Cancer Data Analytics Project

## 📊 Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of lung cancer patient data to uncover insights that can aid in early diagnosis, treatment planning, and awareness. Using real-world inspired datasets, we explore key trends in age distribution, cancer stages, gender patterns, and more, visualized using **Tableau** dashboards.

| `smoking_status`  | Smoking habit status (Smoker/Non-Smoker/Unknown)   |
| `cancer_stage`    | Stage of cancer (Stage I, II, III, IV)             |
| `diagnosis_date`  | Date of cancer diagnosis                            |
| `region`          | Geographic region of the patient                    |
