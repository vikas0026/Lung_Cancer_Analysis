# ü´Å Lung Cancer Data Analytics Project

## üìä Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of lung cancer patient data to uncover insights that can aid in early diagnosis, treatment planning, and awareness. Using real-world inspired datasets, we explore key trends in age distribution, cancer stages, gender patterns, and more, visualized using **Tableau** dashboards.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains patient information with the following columns:

| Column Name       | Description                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `id`              | Unique identifier for each patient                  |
| `age`             | Age of the patient                                  |
| `gender`          | Gender of the patient (Male/Female)                 |
| `smoking_status`  | Smoking habit status (Smoker/Non-Smoker/Unknown)   |
| `cancer_stage`    | Stage of cancer (Stage I, II, III, IV)             |
| `diagnosis_date`  | Date of cancer diagnosis                            |
| `region`          | Geographic region of the patient                    |
| `treatment_type`  | Type of treatment received (Chemotherapy, etc.)     |
| `survival_status` | Survival outcome (Alive/Deceased)                  |

## üßæ Conclusion

The lung cancer data analytics project reveals several critical insights:

1. **Age Distribution**:  
   Patients under 40 and between 70‚Äì79 years represent a significant portion of lung cancer cases, highlighting the need for age-specific awareness and early screening strategies.

2. **Cancer Stage Trends**:  
   Stage II and Stage III cancers are the most prevalent, suggesting diagnoses often occur after the early stage window. This reinforces the urgency for improved early detection programs.

3. **Survival Insights**:  
   Patients diagnosed at **Stage I** and **Stage II** show better survival outcomes, confirming the importance of early intervention. Survival years drop sharply for later stages.

4. **Smoking History**:  
   There is a strong correlation between **current or former smokers** and advanced cancer stages. Non-smokers are more commonly found in Stage I, supporting public health campaigns focused on tobacco cessation.

5. **Gender & Region Patterns**:  
   Males are slightly more affected than females, and regional differences in mortality rates (e.g., higher in the **West**) suggest potential gaps in regional healthcare infrastructure or access.

6. **Hospital Mortality Distribution**:  
   Variation in mortality by region and hospital indicates potential for optimizing treatment protocols and resource allocation in underperforming areas.

7. **Age & Stage Correlation**:  
   The 60‚Äì69 and <40 age groups show wide stage distribution, making them key targets for education and early testing.

### üìå Final Thoughts

These findings can inform:
- üéØ **Policy makers** to allocate resources better.
- üè• **Hospitals** to enhance treatment efficiency.
- üì¢ **Awareness campaigns** focusing on smoking and early diagnosis.
- üß† **Further research** using larger or real-world clinical datasets.

By leveraging interactive dashboards and data storytelling, this project transforms raw clinical data into actionable insights that can save lives.

## üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Use Cases

- For oncologists to understand patient demographics
- For public health policymakers to identify high-risk regions
- For hospitals to improve treatment strategies
- For awareness campaigns based on smoking and stage trends
